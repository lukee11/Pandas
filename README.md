# Unit 4 Homework Assignment: A Whale Off the Port(folio) üêã

### This repository is to evaluate the performance of different algorithmic, hedge, and mutual fund portfolios against the S&P TSX 60 Index.

DataFrames were cleaned, sorted and combined into a single DataFrame. 

Quantitative analysis performed on the data to measure:
* performance
* risk
* rolling statistics
* sharpe ratios

 This analysis was used to compare with another custom portfolio, as well as the larger market ([S&P TSX 60 Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P/TSX_60)).
